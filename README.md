# PANDAS
Pandas is a Python library for data analysis. ... Pandas is built on top of two core Python librariesâ€”matplotlib for data visualization and NumPy for mathematical operations. Pandas acts as a wrapper over these libraries, allowing you to access many of matplotlib's and NumPy's methods with less code.
